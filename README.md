# "llama3-70b-8192" - Balanced
# "gemma2-9b-it" - Fastest
```

### Capture Settings
```python
# config.py
NUM_INITIAL_QUESTIONS = 3           # Number of questions
SCORING_CRITERIA = {
    "clarity": {"weight": 0.3},
    "technical_depth": {"weight": 0.4},
    "completeness": {"weight": 0.3}
}
```

## ⚡ Troubleshooting

**Screen capture not working?**
- Use Chrome browser (required for Web Speech API)
- Make sure to select the correct window

**Voice not transcribing?**
- Check microphone permissions
- Speak clearly
- Chrome only

**API errors?**
- Check your Groq API key in `.env`
- Verify you have free credits at https://console.groq.com

**OCR slow?**
- This is normal on CPU
- System processes screens AFTER you stop (no lag during capture)
